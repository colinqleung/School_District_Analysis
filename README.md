# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze the data, from Excel, of the students of a single district from different schools. For the individual schools, I was given varaibles such as budget, school size, and school type (charter or district). Moreover, I was given the amount of total students who passed math, passed reading, and passed both subjects. The primary products of my project was the ranking of each school in the district based on overall passing percentages of both math and reading and the average passing percentages of all students grouped by grade, school spending per student, school size, and school type. Additionally, once it was discovered that the 9th grade passing rates from a certain school was tampered with, I then created new data set that removed only the data values of the students whos grades were false and created new analysis dataframes using the new amount of total students.
